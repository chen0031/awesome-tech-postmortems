# Awesome Tech Postmortems [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

The postmortems, studies, and resources curated here are those which enable learning
from incidents.

> PSA: _Incident Analysis_ is completely different than the standard postmortem process
> that you see written about in the Google SRE book and other incident marketing
> materials. It is a whole field of study and practice on extracting valuable data from
> incidents focusing on how.

The postmortems linked generally do not meet the bar that Jones suggests for _incident

the studies and resources linked do line up with the incident analysis perspective.
